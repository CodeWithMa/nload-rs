# Third-party dependency notices

Reviewed on 2026-10-02 against `Cargo.lock` and the downloaded crate license
files. All six locked third-party packages declare `MIT OR Apache-2.0` and
provide the MIT texts reproduced below. The selected route for each is **MIT**,
compatible with this application's GPL-2.0-only license. These notices preserve
the dependencies' own grants; they do not change the application's license.

| Package | Locked version | Linux target | Notice source in crate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| libc | 0.2.189 | Direct; also shared by transitives | `LICENSE-MIT` |
| signal-hook | 0.4.4 | Direct, default features disabled | `LICENSE-MIT` |
| signal-hook-registry | 1.4.8 | Via signal-hook | `LICENSE-MIT` |
| errno | 0.3.14 | Via signal-hook-registry | `LICENSE-MIT` |
| windows-sys | 0.61.2 | Not built; errno's Windows-only dependency | `license-mit` |
| windows-link | 0.2.1 | Not built; via windows-sys | `license-mit` |

## libc 0.2.189
